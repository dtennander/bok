# Bok

A git inspired solution for local Accounting.

## Get started

To install it locally you can run:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dtennander/bok
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is very much a work in progress! So all help is appreciated!

## TODO

- [ ] Scrape bar.se/kontoplaner and look for `data-src` on the `a` tag.
